Despite the pain that sometimes I feel, what I learned since childhood is that life is stronger than anything, including bombs and fanatic ideologies”. \n\nWorld Humanitarian Day, designated by the UN General Assembly to be observed on 19 August, remembers aid workers who paid the utmost sacrifice in the line of duty and pays tribute to those who deliver aid to vulnerable communities in some of the world’s most dangerous crises.\n\nScreenshot Credit: Photo by UN Geneva/Violaine Martin\n\n#NotATarget","creators":[{"given":"United Nations","role":"publisher"}]},"duration":105.2},"45322e14-5b03-4603-90a1-db0c774d670e":{"metadata":{"id":"45322e14-5b03-4603-90a1-db0c774d670e","createdAt":1533942009000,"lastModifiedAt":1537030373787,"mediaUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIX3SsSbu2M","mediaThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xIX3SsSbu2M/hqdefault.jpg","title":"International Youth Day 2018 - UN Chief and UN Youth Envoy","description":"Video message by H.E.

For Full Visit: http://webtv.un.org/watch/press-conference-4-june-2018/5793359057001\n\nA new report released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says positive developments show that the renewable energy transition is possible, but advances so far are uneven across sectors. \n\nSpeaking to reporters in New York, Laura Williamson from the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21) said “renewable power accounted for 70 per cent of net additions to global power generating capacity which is the largest increase of renewable power capacity in modern history. A lot of this was thanks to new solar PV.”\n\nShe added “capacity which at the end of the year had a 98 giga watts installed capacity. So to put that in context that’s equivalent to about 40,000 PV panels being installed hourly across 2017.” \n\nAccording to the Renewables 2018 Global Status Report, the year 2017 was another record-breaking one for renewable energy, characterised by the largest ever increase in renewable power capacity, falling costs, increases in investment and advances in enabling technologies.\n\nWilliamson said “thanks to the technology advances and dramatic reductions in cost of, in particular solar PV and wind, renewable electricity is now less expensive than newly installed fossil and nuclear power generation in many parts of the world. And in some parts of the world, it’s even less expensive than the current operating conventional power plants.”\n\nThe report also says while China, Europe and the United States accounted for nearly 75 per cent of the global investment in renewable power and fuels, 2017 saw significant investment in developing country markets. When measured per unit of gross domestic product, the Marshall Islands, Rwanda, the Solomon Islands, Guinea-Bissau and many other developing countries are investing as much as or more in renewables than developed and emerging economies. These positive developments need to be scaled up for a global energy transition.\n\nThe report also noted that though strong growth continued in the renewable power sector, other renewable sectors grew very slowly. Solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity installations were remarkable – nearly double those of wind power (in second place) – adding more net capacity than coal, natural gas and nuclear power combined.\n\nThe report says there is slow progress in renewable energy uptake in heating and cooling. Energy demand for cooling is growing rapidly, and access to cooling is an issue for health and well-being. Renewables currently play a small role in providing cooling services, although there is considerable potential. \n\nIn addition, renewable energy progress in the transport sector remains slow. Biofuels provide most of the current renewable energy contribution, although electrification is gaining attention.","creators":[{"given":"United Nations","role":"publisher"}]},"duration":75.43},"f4a46fcb-fa69-4577-944e-47e246dee22d":{"metadata":{"id":"f4a46fcb-fa69-4577-944e-47e246dee22d","createdAt":1527159610000,"lastModifiedAt":1537030373787,"mediaUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpB5oF6CyYA","mediaThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zpB5oF6CyYA/maxresdefault.jpg","title":"Int’l Day of United Nations Peacekeepers - António Guterres (UN Secretary-General)","description":"Video message by H.E.

Mr. António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, at the Security Council meeting on the protection of civilians in armed conflict.\n\nUN Security Council, 8264th meeting\n\nAddressing a Security Council debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, Secretary-General António Guterres today (22 May) stressed that “the most effective way to protect civilians is to prevent conflicts and to end them.”\n\nGuterres reiterated that “conflict prevention, resolution and peacebuilding are, and will remain, the highest priorities for the whole United Nations system.”\n\nThe Secretary-General noted that “conflict around the world is unleashing relentless horror and suffering for millions of civilians, women, girls, men and boys.” He said, “more than 128 million people around the world need immediate humanitarian aid, and this staggering figure is mainly driven by conflict.”\n\nHe urged Council Members “not to allow political differences to prevent or undermine action to protect civilians.”\n\nGuterres said this was “vital not only to save lives and safeguard our common humanity” as “protecting civilians in conflict is also the only way to lay the foundations for sustained peace.”\n\nHe called on Member States to develop national policies to protect civilians in conflict and to ensure accountability for serious violations against them. \n\nThe Director-General of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Yves Daccord, told the Council “there is clearly still a long way to go before the various normative and policy achievements regarding protection of civilians are felt where they really matter. Not on paper, but on the ground.”\n\nHe highlighted four particular areas, namely: “To avoid the use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas. To counter a wide range of threats to health care. To ensure humane treatment and conditions of detention for all detainees. And to commit to preventing people from going missing and properly accounting for those who do.” \n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Jacek Krzysztof, told the Council it was “important that all states and non-state parties to the conflicts comply with their legal obligations” and said it was “crucial to implement good practices in this field.”\n\nPoland holds the presidency of the Council for the month of May.","creators":[{"given":"United Nations","role":"publisher"}]},"duration":483.02},"39a524a8-efa6-453a-bdc9-e33e0ac036a8":{"metadata":{"id":"39a524a8-efa6-453a-bdc9-e33e0ac036a8","createdAt":1526571550000,"lastModifiedAt":1537030373787,"mediaUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFYxylNleDo","mediaThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OFYxylNleDo/maxresdefault.jpg","title":"UN Free & Equal: Be there.

At least 236 civilians were killed and 238 injured in Yemen in only April – a total of 474 civilian casualties, this is well over double the 180 civilian casualties documented in March this year.”\n\nThe bloodshed has continued in May as government forces backed by a Saudi-led international coalition battle a Houthi-led opposition, in a conflict that escalated in 2015.\n\nAccording to the OHCHR, there have been 63 civilian casualties so far this month, including six deaths.\n\nShamdasani said that recent attacks against targets in residential areas “raise serious doubts” about respect for internationally recognized rules of war.\n\nShe said, “we are deeply concerned about the sharp increase in civilian casualties and call, again, on all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law.”\n\nOn Monday, airstrikes targeted the Presidential Office in Sana’a, a Houthi stronghold.\n\nThe OHCHR spokesperson said that information gathered by the UN human rights office in Yemen indicated that first raid “directly hit” the Presidential Office, which is located in a densely populated area. \n\nShamdasani added that “eyewitnesses told us that the same building was hit again about seven minutes after the first strike, causing additional casualties among the first responders to the first strike.”\n\nElsewhere, Shamdasani added that there had also been casualties resulting from “apparent indiscriminate shelling” by Houthis.\n\nThese included recent incidents on 1 and 2 May, during which five civilians were injured and one was killed, she told journalists.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen has caused immense suffering throughout the country, which was heavily reliant on external imports of food, fuel and medicines before the fighting erupted.\n\nAccording to OCHA, a total of 22.2 million people in Yemen need humanitarian or protection assistance urgently.\n\nThis includes more than 8.4 million people who are severely food insecure and at risk of starvation, and 16.4 million who lack access to adequate healthcare.\n\nWatch the full briefing: http://webtv.un.org/watch/geneva-press-briefing-who-ocha-unicef-ohchr-unhcr/5783534662001/#t=34m06s","creators":[{"given":"United Nations","role":"publisher"}]},"duration":36.48},"cc979adb-cf67-40e9-87c4-c1d817273b57":{"metadata":{"id":"cc979adb-cf67-40e9-87c4-c1d817273b57","createdAt":1525808363000,"lastModifiedAt":1537030373787,"mediaUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKyIlBOPcPE","mediaThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tKyIlBOPcPE/maxresdefault.jpg","title":"US Withdrawal from Iran Nuclear Deal - UN Chief Urges Continued Support","description":"Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “deeply concerned” by today’s announcement that the United States will be withdrawing from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and will begin reinstating US sanctions.\n\nIn a statement read Tuesday (8 May) by his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, Guterres noted that he consistently reiterated that the JCPOA represented a “major achievement” in nuclear non-proliferation and diplomacy and had contributed to regional and international peace and security. \n\nHe also said “It is essential that all concerns regarding the implementation of the Plan be addressed through the mechanisms established in the JCPOA.
